                <p>
                    I find myself in a continuous search for knowledge; about everything. And despite the great joy ideas already provide, I'm also always looking foward for more concrete delight. Because as Walter Isaacson writes and I came to strongly agree, theory alone tends to pure imagination, which is hallucination; practice alone, on the other hand, tends to pure execution, which is esterile. Having instead not only the "know how", the practical part, but also the "know why", the understanding behind the process, is key to innovation, more especifically, to technological innovation.

                <h3 class="brf">Resume</h3>
                <p>
                    I am currently a Software Engineering student at FIAP. My undergraduate journey, however, started 3 years ago. In 2021 I initiated Physics Engineering at UFSCar, a Federal University in Brazil, one of the country's greatests institutions. Soon after, in 2022, I was awarded <i>University Talent</i> by CAPES, the same time period in which I started an intership at Pentagro, reference in agroindustry 4.0.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Around the middle of 2023, however, I decided to drop out of college. And since I was in one of the best institutions for exact sciences, innovation and technology, my decision may seem pretty illogical at first thought. My argument back then was that the university was not what I was expecting: not all people were great and dedicated students; sometimes the public system was not very efficient; student strikes often compromised regular classes... just not the radiant and perfect image of an intellectual environment I had in my mind. But that was the problem; I used to think that "ideal" or "almost perfect" were concepts that could fit reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In High school, preparing for universities admission tests, that mindset actually worked out really well. I was in a predictable environment, in which I knew all the variables I had to take into account, and causality was straight and absolute. Thus, if I worked hard and gained domain over all the parameters, success was granted. I knew how many questions I had to solve during a certain interval of time, and how they would look like, I had all the covered topics mapped out and also, the most important thing: I had a measurable and concrete goal. Therefore, every variable or topic of study could be placed in a closed and perfect system (or placed in post-its all over my room) in such a way that if you had control over them, you would certaily succeed. And I mastered this system. All highest scores, praises and awards for outstanding performance in tests. And this was my measure of success.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When going to college and real life, however, little did I know that "predictable", "control" and "ideal" were words that could not be applied anymore. There are countless and actually infinite uncontrollable variables involved in the real world, and it's not even possible to have only one simple and concrete goal to achive, like a score in a test. In a manner that if you try to control this uncontrollable environment, you will inevitably get frustrated. And that is what happened to me. Balancing multiple spheres at once: college tasks and work demands; integrating different social groups; trying to find your path amongst infinite possibilities... all this unpredictability by itself and on top of that expecting "perfect" and "ideal" in every sphere? It is simply not possible. And an illusory expectation is the way to frustration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today I know that the real reason why I left college was because I could not deal with the fact that <i>I had no control over everything</i>. I used to think I left university because it "was not at my level" or because of any other aspect that was not "ideal". But the crushing reality was that <i>I was not ideal</i>. No one can be. Moving to the present day, I do not like to label this choice of mine as a regret or not; I simply think this type of question does not add up in any way since it is not possible to go back in time. Instead, I like to think that, in the present moment, I still cannot see all the efects of this choice, once "it only ends when it ends". Therefore, what I actually like to do is to think of what I <i>want</i> this choice to mean. What I can and <i>will</i> make it mean. I prefer these much stronger and impactful words, that actually leads to action and, consequently, to change. It was a big lesson, to say the least, of reality. And, finally, what I will make this decision mean, dropping out of a great college, is that by doing so I could redirect myself to another field: Software Engineering and Data Science - a field that has been making profound impact in the world and that still has the potential to push so many bounderies. And I want to be a part and see the future from as close as I can.
